            Hi, I'm <strong>Jeff Axel Orig</strong><sub>Jep</sub>, a first-year student at the University of Bohol, diving into the world of computer engineering. I'm fascinated by how things in technology work, and my goal is to learn how to create cool stuff in the future through this course. The idea of building and understanding the inner workings of tech excites me every day, and I can't wait to explore even more.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
            When I'm not in class, I love playing mobile gamesâ€”they're my go-to for fun. Mangoes are my favorite snack, and I enjoy spending time with my small group of friends, who make my college experience even better. Whether we're studying together or just hanging out, their support means a lot to me.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 20px;">
            I'm not just here for a degree; I want to understand tech deeply and contribute something cool to the world. Along this journey, I'm excited about growing personally and professionally, making a positive impact, building friendships, and enjoying the joy of always learning. Plus, I can't wait to use what I learn in computer engineering to solve real-world problems and make a difference.
